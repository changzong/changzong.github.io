I receive my Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University ([ZJU(https://www.zju.edu.cn/)]), advised by [Prof. Yueting Zhuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang). I received my Bachelor's Degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)). I received my Master's Degree in the School of Informatics from the University of Edinburgh([UoE](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)), UK. I am currently a lecturer in Zhejiang University of Science and Technology ([ZUST](https://www.zust.edu.cn/)).
