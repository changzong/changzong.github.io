## Academic Career
I receive my Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University ([ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn/)), co-advised by [Prof. Yueting Zhuang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/yzhuang), [Prof. Jian Shao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/jshao), [Prof. Weiming Lu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/lwm), and [Prof. Siliang Tang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/siliang) . I received my Bachelor's Degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology from Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)). I received my Master's Degree in the School of Informatics from the University of Edinburgh ([UoE](https://www.ed.ac.uk/)), UK. I am currently a lecturer in Zhejiang University of Science and Technology ([ZUST](https://www.zust.edu.cn/)), working in [BIT Lab](http://bit.zust.edu.cn/catalogue/information.html).
